SQL vs NoSQL

**Type- sql databases are called RDBMS where nosql database are called
non-RDBMS
** Language- sql is quite complex, extremely powerful and structured.
nosql is quite simple, non-powerful and unstructured.
** scalability- sql databases are vertically scalable. you can increase 
the load of server if you increase things like ram, cpu or ssd.

nosql is horizontally scalable. adding more servers in my database can
handle more traffic.

it is like sql is adding more floors to the same building vs adding more 
buildings to the neighbourhood. so nosql databases are more powerful.

**structure- sql databases are table-based where nosql databases
are either key-value pairs, document-based.
